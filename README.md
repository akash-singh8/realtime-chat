# Realtime Chat

This project enables two clients to establish a WebRTC connection with zero dependencies. It provides a simple mechanism where clients can manually exchange Session Description Protocol (SDP) tokens to establish a peer-to-peer connection.

## Features

- **WebRTC Connectivity:** Establish a real-time communication channel between two clients using WebRTC.
- **Zero Dependencies:** The project is designed to be lightweight and has no external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into various environments.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the WebRTC connection into your project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akash-singh8/realtime-chat.git
cd realtime-chat
```

### 2. Launch the Application
Open the project in your preferred code editor and serve the files using a local development server (`Live Server`) or directly open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### 3. Manually Exchange SDP Tokens
The two clients should manually exchange SDP tokens to establish a connection. You can use any method to transmit the SDP tokens between the clients (e.g., copy-pasting, messaging, WhatsApp).

### 4. Establish Connection
Once the SDP tokens are exchanged, the clients can initiate the WebRTC connection. Check the console for any log messages related to the connection status.
